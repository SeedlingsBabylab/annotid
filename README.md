# Archived code to create annotatiion IDs

Annotation IDs for seedlings annotations used to be created with scripts from this folder using a virtual machine with the database of annotation IDs.
The virtual machine was shut down, these scripts won't work.
See [this](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LD2B3y79nAYcWKjWKTb/s/-LD2B3y86yJyNeihFLqD/data-pipeline/audio/audio-add-annotation-ids#why-we-dont-have-an-annotid-adding-script-anymore) note on GitBook.

All the code is still here - in `archived/`.

Note from Zhenya: when I "archived" this repo, there were a lot of unsaved changes in the clone on pn-opus. Those are saved on the `20230526_changes-on-pn-opus_backup` branch.
